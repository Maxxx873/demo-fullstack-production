## Build an APK

From the command line:

Enter cd [project]
Run flutter build apk --split-per-abi
(The flutter build command defaults to --release.)

This command results in three APK files:

[project]/build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk
[project]/build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-arm64-v8a-release.apk
[project]/build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-x86_64-release.apkf
